# touch_to_open

touch the touch senso to make the servo move 90 degree

## Hardware Required

* Arduino Board
* Servo Motor
* Hook-up wires
* touch sensor

## Circuit

Servo motors have three wires: power, ground, and signal. The power wire is typically red, and should be connected to the 5V pin on the Arduino board. The ground wire is typically black or brown and should be connected to a ground pin on the board. The signal pin is typically yellow, orange or white and should be connected to pin 9 on the board.
